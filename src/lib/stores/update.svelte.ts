/**
 * The updater's state - WS4 task 4.4.
 *
 * **Quiet about interrupting, not about telling.** CI publishes a release for
 * every commit on `main`, so "something newer exists" is true most days, and a
 * toast or a system notification on each one is noise the user learns to
 * dismiss without reading. The announcement is a dot and nothing more.
 *
 * What the panel says is a separate question, and the answer is: as much as it
 * has. The version, and what changed, because deciding whether to restart
 * mid-session is the user's call and they cannot make it from a version number
 * alone. See DEVELOPMENT.md §14.
 *
 * The one thing that interrupts is the backend **refusing** an install, since
 * the user pressed a button and is owed an answer. A failed download reports
 * itself in the row instead: they are already looking at it.
