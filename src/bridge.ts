/**
 * The frontend's one way to reach the backend.
 *
 * Since WS2.6 this is a thin composition root rather than an implementation:
 * it picks a transport (`lib/transport/`) and exposes the generated client
 * (`lib/contract/`) over it. The Tauri `invoke` plumbing moved to
 * `transport/invoke.ts` and the several hundred lines of dev fixtures moved to
 * `transport/mock.ts`, which is what lets Vitest drive the real client with
 * neither a daemon nor a WebView2 behind it.
 *
 * `call` survives unchanged, because the existing views are written against it
 * and WS2.6's exit criterion is that frontend behaviour does not move. New
 * code should prefer `client`, which is typed per command; `call` is what WS4
 * strangles as each view is rewritten.
