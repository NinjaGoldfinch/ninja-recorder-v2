//! Every command's actual logic, with no `tauri::` in a single signature.
//!
//! Until now these bodies lived in `lib.rs` as `#[tauri::command]`
//! functions, which meant the only way to run one was for a webview to
//! invoke it. That is a problem for the process split
//! ([DEVELOPMENT.md §12](../../../DEVELOPMENT.md)): the recorder daemon has
//! no webview, and Tauri v2 offers no way to call a registered command by
//! name from Rust. So the logic moves here, behind a plain `Ctx`, and
//! `lib.rs` keeps only thin `#[tauri::command]` wrappers over it.
//!
//! **Nothing in this module may name a `tauri` type.** That is not tidiness:
//! this module is unit-testable, and `state_machine::supervisor` documents
//! at length what happens when Wry becomes reachable from a module with
//! tests — the Win32 GUI stack lands in the `cargo test` binary, which has
//! no application manifest, and the binary dies at load with
//! `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`. Paths that used to come from
//! `AppHandle` are resolved once at startup and handed over in `Ctx`; the
//! one place that needs to emit a Tauri event does it through a type-erased
//! closure, exactly as `Supervisor::set_library_changed_notifier` does.
//!
//! Two commands deliberately stay behind in `lib.rs` rather than moving
//! here: `open_recordings_folder` and the dev portal's `dev_open_portal`.
//! Both drive the desktop shell — an opener call and a window — which only
//! the UI process can meaningfully do.
