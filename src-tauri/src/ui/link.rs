//! The UI's connection to the daemon, and the two commands that expose it to
//! the webview. WS3 task 3.4.
//!
//! `client` is the protocol half: reply routing, reconnect, skew refusal.
//! This is what hangs it off a Tauri app, so the frontend can reach the daemon
//! without knowing a pipe exists.
//!
//! ## Two commands, not thirty
//!
//! `rpc_call` forwards a name and a JSON blob, exactly as `rpc` did when the
//! commands ran in this process. The frontend's transport changes which
//! function it calls and nothing else: the wire shape, the argument spelling
//! and the error strings are the ones `core::dispatch` already produced, so
//! every view keeps working across the move.
//!
//! `rpc_subscribe` is how the webview learns what happened. It does not return
//! a stream: it asks for the current snapshot, and everything after that
//! arrives as the `event` the contract already defines. A window that has just
//! opened therefore does exactly what a reconnecting client does, which is the
//! shape WS2.4 chose the snapshot for.
//!
//! ## The daemon is started, not required
//!
//! `daemon::spawn::connect_or_start` is the connect factory, so a UI launched
//! on a machine with no daemon starts one rather than showing an error. That
//! is the recovery path rather than the normal one: after WS3.5 the Run key
//! starts a daemon at login and this only fires when someone has quit it, it
//! crashed, or this is a first launch.
//!
//! ## No tests live in this file, and none should
//!
//! It names `AppHandle`, `Emitter` and `Manager`, and is reachable only from
//! `lib.rs`'s `run()`, which is dead code in a `cargo test` build and gets
//! stripped. That is what keeps Tauri's Wry window machinery, and with it the
//! whole Win32 GUI import stack, out of the test binary: a `cargo test` binary
//! carries no application manifest, so Windows resolves `comctl32.dll` to the
//! v5 side-by-side assembly and the binary dies at load with
//! `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND` before running anything. `tray.rs` carries the
//! same warning and `state_machine::supervisor` documents the incident.
//!
//! What is worth testing is either side of this file and already is: the
//! protocol and the reconnect are `client`'s tests, against a real server; the
//! routing is `src/lib/transport/pipe.test.ts`. What is left here is the part
//! that needs a window, which is what `docs/windows-verification.md` is for.
//!
//! ## What the UI no longer has
//!
//! No supervisor, no capture backend, no watchers. `lib.rs` used to build all
//! three; killing the window used to kill them with it, which is the whole
//! thing WS3 exists to end. What is left in this process is the window, the
//! tray, the shell commands, and this.
