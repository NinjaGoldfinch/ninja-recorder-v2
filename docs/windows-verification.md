# Windows verification checklist

Capture has now run across many live Vanguard-protected games, so the gap this
checklist existed to close is **closed**. Capture, markers, multi-track audio,
the tray and the notifications all hold up on real hardware.

It stands as the record of what was checked, and as the procedure for
re-checking after a change to the capture backend. None of it is executable
from the dev box: it needs real Windows hardware, a real League client and
Vanguard active
([DEVELOPMENT.md §1.1, §9](../DEVELOPMENT.md#11-riot-vanguard-the-constraint-that-shapes-everything)).

**Still open:** the *install* half of the updater (§5.0.4), which has never
run end to end, and the install-size budget (§5), which is missed rather than
met. Fill in results inline as each remaining step is done.

```

## 0. Prerequisites

- [ ] Latest `main` has a green CI run on `windows-latest`
- [ ] League of Legends installed and up to date on the Windows box
- [ ] **No dev toolchain involved in the app under test.** No `cargo run`, no
      `npm run tauri dev` for this pass. The dev loop already covers
      everything short of a real installer and real Vanguard; this pass exists
      specifically to catch what that loop cannot.

## 1. Install from a CI artifact

- [ ] Download `ninja-recorder-windows-latest-<sha>` from the latest `main` CI
      run, or take the installer off that run's Release instead, if
      this pass is also meant to validate what a release actually ships
- [ ] Run the NSIS installer on a clean-ish user account (not the profile used
      for `cargo run` testing, if avoidable; the goal is to catch anything
      leftover dev state hides)
- [ ] Launch the installed app from the Start Menu / desktop shortcut, not
      from a terminal

Record: installer filename, version, SmartScreen prompt behaviour (expected on
an unsigned build).

## 2. Full loop: client detected → recording → markers → VOD in library

Use Practice Tool first: 30-second launch, on-demand kills and objectives.
Never iterate against real queued games.

- [ ] League client launch is detected (lockfile discovery)
- [ ] Gameflow phase transitions drive the state machine into `Recording` when
      a Practice Tool game starts
- [ ] Recording file appears and grows during the game
- [ ] Markers are captured (kills, objectives) and time-aligned
- [ ] On game end the VOD and its markers land in the library: SQLite row,
      visible in the review UI
- [ ] Playback works in the review UI and markers seek correctly

Record: any step that didn't fire, or fired late or wrong.

## 3. Vanguard-protected game

- [ ] The Practice Tool run above completed with Vanguard active and no flags
      or warnings from Vanguard or Riot
- [ ] Repeat the full loop once during a **live queued game**, not just
      Practice Tool. This confirms behaviour under real matchmaking timing
      (champ select, dodges) per the documented state machine edge cases in
      [recording-pipeline.md](recording-pipeline.md#2-the-state-machine)

Record: queue type, and anything that differed from Practice Tool.

## 4. Capture resilience

For each, confirm the recording continues or recovers cleanly and the final
VOD is playable:

- [ ] Alt-tab out of League and back mid-game
- [ ] In-game resolution change mid-recording
- [ ] Mid-game reconnect: disconnect the client (brief network drop or manual
      client kill), then reconnect; exercises the `Reconnect` path
- [ ] Unplug the microphone mid-game on a mic preset. The recording should
      survive with its remaining tracks rather than failing

Record: pass/fail per case, and what the output VOD looked like for any
failure (gap, corruption, truncation).

## 5. Resource measurements

First real measurement against the targets in
[DEVELOPMENT.md §1.2](../DEVELOPMENT.md#12-lightweight-is-a-tracked-requirement).

| Metric | Target | Measured | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| Installed size | ≤ 200 MB | **248 MB**, over | `Get-ChildItem -Recurse \| Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum` on the install folder |
| Installer | none | 64 MB | the NSIS `.exe` on the release page, LZMA-compressed, roughly a quarter of what it unpacks to |
| Idle RAM | ≤ 100 MB | **9 MB**, well under | Task Manager / `Get-Process` working set, app idle, no League running |
| Recording overhead | Hardware encoder only, no x264 | | Confirm encoder choice in app logs during §2/§3 |
| Idle CPU | ~0% | | Task Manager, app idle with the client closed |

**The size target is missed, and that is recorded rather than rounded.** 248 MB
against a 200 MB budget ([DEVELOPMENT.md §1.2](../DEVELOPMENT.md)); the binary
is 64 MB of it and the rest is bundled libobs plus ffmpeg. Whether the budget
was wrong or the bundle is, it is not a pass. Idle RAM went the other way, at
9 MB against 100 MB, which is what staying out of Electron bought.

**Measure idle RAM with the client closed *and* open.** The capture backend is
now warm only while the League client is running
([DEVELOPMENT.md §2.2](../DEVELOPMENT.md#22-the-recorder-trait)), so those are
two different numbers and only the first is the §1.2 target. Confirm from Task
Manager that **no `extprocess_recorder.exe` exists at all** before the client
starts, that one appears within a few seconds of it starting, and that it goes
away again when the client closes.

**The 9 MB above is a Working Set reading taken once, with the window closed.**
That is one of six numbers it could have been, and not the one v2 is measured
against. [§5.2](#52-memory-by-the-v2-method) below is the method that replaces
it; this table and its figures are left exactly as they were recorded.

### 5.0 Launch modes

The main window is created in Rust now rather than by `tauri.conf.json`, and
argv selects the mode. Verified off Windows; the Windows behaviour of a windowless
process is what needs confirming.

- [ ] A normal start still opens the window at 1160x800 with an 880x600
      minimum, titled `ninja-recorder`.
- [ ] `ninja-recorder.exe --hidden` starts with **no** window and no taskbar
      button, and is reachable from the tray icon.
- [ ] `ninja-recorder.exe --daemon` starts headless and stays running, with no
      window and no taskbar button. It used to print a refusal and exit 2;
      since WS3.2 it is the daemon, and §5.0.5 is where it is checked.
- [ ] Unknown arguments (a shell verb, a file path from "Open with") do not
      prevent startup.

### 5.0.1 Tray and the close button

Verified off Windows only as far as a script can go: the tray builds without
error, a default start creates a webview and `--hidden` creates none (0 WebKit
handles vs 4). **Everything below needs a real click and none of it is covered
by a test.**

- [ ] The tray icon appears, with a tooltip, and its menu has exactly three
      items: Open ninja-recorder / Settings / Quit.
- [ ] Left-click opens the window; right-click opens the menu.
- [ ] "Settings" opens the window **on the settings view**, both when a window
      already exists (a `navigate` event) and when one does not (the
      `index.html#settings` fragment). These are different code paths.
- [ ] With Close = "Close the window" (the default), the X destroys the window
      and the process keeps running in the tray. Reopening from the tray works,
      and does so repeatedly.
- [ ] With Close = "Hide the window", the X hides it and reopening is instant.
- [ ] With Close = "Quit", the X quits.
- [ ] **Quit mid-recording finalizes rather than dropping the game**: start a
      recording, Quit from the tray, relaunch, and confirm the VOD is in the
      library with its markers, not adopted as an untracked file by
      `reconcile`.
- [ ] The tray icon survives an `explorer.exe` restart (kill it from Task
      Manager and confirm the icon comes back).
- [ ] Measure idle RAM with the window closed vs hidden. The whole premise of
      "close-window" as the default is that hiding reclaims nothing.

### 5.0.2 Start on login

The one setting that writes outside the app's own data, and the one whose
source of truth is not ours: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
Nothing in `cargo test` can reach it (`Ctx::new` leaves the control unset), and
the dev loop exercises a LaunchAgent or a `.desktop` entry, not this, so every
row below is Windows-only.

**Check the registry directly, not just the checkbox**, since the checkbox is
supposed to be a report of that key and the whole failure mode is the two
disagreeing:

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run' |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'ninja-recorder'
```

- [ ] A fresh install registers **nothing**: the key is absent and the
      Settings checkbox is off before it is ever touched.
- [ ] Ticking it creates the value, and it holds the installed exe's full path
      **followed by `--hidden`**. A path with no flag means a login start that
      opens a window.
- [ ] Unticking it removes the value entirely.
- [ ] The setting survives a restart of the app: reopen Settings and confirm
      the checkbox still reflects the key.
- [ ] **Sign out and back in.** The app comes up with no window and no taskbar
      button, the tray icon is there, and the recorder is live. Start a game
      without opening the window and confirm it records.
- [ ] Delete the entry from **Task Manager → Startup** with the app running,
      then reopen Settings: the checkbox must now read *off*. This is the case
      the "no `settings_kv` mirror" decision exists for
      ([DEVELOPMENT.md §12](../DEVELOPMENT.md#12-process-model-a-recorder-daemon-and-a-ui-that-can-leave)).
- [ ] Disabling the entry in Task Manager (rather than deleting it): note what
      the checkbox says. Windows records that state outside the `Run` key, so
      the app is expected to still report "on"; confirm it, and that toggling
      off then on clears it.
- [ ] Uninstall with autostart enabled, then check the key: NSIS does not know
      about it, so a stale entry pointing at a removed exe is the expected and
      harmless outcome. Confirm it does not produce an error dialog on
      the next login.
- [ ] Reinstall over an existing install with autostart on: the path must still
      resolve, or the entry silently stops working.
- [ ] Both product names side by side (`ninja-recorder` and
      `ninja-recorder-dev`) get **separate** `Run` values; confirm enabling one
      does not show as enabled in the other.

### 5.0.3 Notifications

**None of this can be checked before installing.** The plugin only sets the
`System.AppUserModel.ID` for a non-`target/debug|release` exe, and Windows
resolves it through the Start-menu shortcut NSIS creates, so a dev run shows
nothing and that is expected. The decision logic (which kinds are enabled, the
one-time notice) is unit tested; presentation is not testable anywhere but here.

- [ ] Closing the window the first time shows the "still running in the tray"
      notice, and closing it again does **not**.
- [ ] Settings → Notifications → Reset makes that notice appear once more.
- [ ] Finishing a game shows "Recording saved" with the file name and marker
      count.
- [ ] Turning the master switch off silences everything, including the
      one-time notice, and greys out the other three checkboxes.
- [ ] A recording that fails to start (try filling the disk below 1 GiB) shows
      the problem notification.
- [ ] Toasts are **display-only**; clicking one is expected to do nothing.
      Confirm it at least does not crash or mis-focus.
- [ ] Both product names get their own Start-menu shortcut and therefore their
      own AUMID; confirm `ninja-recorder` and `ninja-recorder-dev` do not
      collide.

### 5.0.4 In-app updates

**Nothing about this is testable off Windows, and none of it without two
builds on the same channel.** The gate, whether an offered update may be
installed, is pure and unit-tested (`update::decide`); everything below it
is not ([DEVELOPMENT.md §14](../DEVELOPMENT.md#14-updates)).

**Use the alpha channel.** Every commit on `main` publishes one, so getting a
newer build is one merge rather than a deliberate release: set Settings →
About → Update channel to Alpha, install an alpha, land any commit, and the
next check offers its successor. On stable the same exercise costs two
deliberate cuts ([DEVELOPMENT.md §15](../DEVELOPMENT.md)).

Whichever channel, the versions must move **forwards**. An alpha is below the
stable release it precedes, so an alpha install offered a stable build is
being offered an upgrade, and a stable install will never be offered an alpha
at all. That is the design, not a fault.

- [ ] Both manifests resolve and name the build they should:
      `curl -L .../releases/latest/download/latest.json` (stable) and
      `curl -L .../releases/download/alpha/alpha.json` (alpha). Each `url`
      must point at that release's **tagged** asset, not `/latest/`.
- [ ] Switching the channel re-checks immediately, and the row changes to
      describe the channel just selected rather than the one left behind.
- [ ] A **stable** install is never offered an alpha, even with alphas newer
      in time. This is the one that a comparison-based implementation would
      get wrong, since semver says `1.1.0-alpha.1 > 1.0.0`.
- [ ] About 30 s after launch, a dot appears on the settings button and
      Settings → About names the newer version. **Nothing else happens**: no
      toast, no Windows notification, no dialog. That is the design, not a
      missing piece.
- [ ] "Check now" produces the same answer without waiting.
- [ ] **The gate.** Start a game. While the header reads Recording, the Install
      button is disabled and the row says why. Confirm the same during
      `Game starting…` and `Saving…`. All three refuse.
- [ ] The button re-enables on its own once the game ends, **without**
      reopening Settings or restarting the app. This is the `status.ts` edge
      refresh; if it needs a reload, that hook is broken.
- [ ] Install. The app exits, the NSIS installer runs *passively* (a progress
      bar, no wizard to click through), and the app comes back. Settings →
      About now shows the new version and offers nothing.
- [ ] The install did **not** create a second entry in Apps & Features, a
      second Start-menu shortcut, or a second install directory.
- [ ] Start-on-login, the close-button setting, the audio preset and the
      retention policy all survive the update; they live in `settings_kv` and
      the `Run` key, neither of which the installer touches.
- [ ] The VOD library survives it: recordings are still listed, and their files
      still play.
- [ ] **Install the devtools bundle and confirm it offers nothing at all.**
      Settings → About must read "not available in this build". A dev bundle
      that updated itself would replace itself with the production app, which
      is exactly what renaming the product was meant to prevent.
- [ ] Pull the network cable and press "Check now": the row reports the failure
      in words and the app carries on recording normally.
- [ ] Tamper check, which needs a scratch release: replace the installer
      attached to a release without updating `latest.json`, and confirm the
      download is **rejected** rather than run. This is the only test that
      exercises the signature at all.

### 5.0.5 The daemon process

`--daemon` runs the recorder with no Tauri, no window and no WebView2
(WS3.2). All of it has been exercised on a Linux dev box over a Unix socket,
which is the same code path with a different address: the daemon started,
opened the library, served a client, recorded through the stub backend,
reported a second launch as already running, and shut down cleanly on Ctrl-C.
None of that has been run on Windows, where the address is a named pipe and the
backend is libobs, and this section is what stands in for that.

- [ ] `ninja-recorder.exe --daemon` starts and keeps running. Task Manager
      shows one process and **no** `msedgewebview2.exe` alongside it.
- [ ] `app_data_dir()/logs/daemon.log` is created and names the pipe it bound.
      The UI's own log is `ui.log` beside it, and neither rotates the other.
- [ ] The pipe exists while the daemon runs. From PowerShell:
      `[System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles("\\.\pipe\") -match "ninja-recorder"`
      should list `ninja-recorder.com.ninjarecorder.app.release`, or
      `...devtools` for a devtools build.
- [ ] A devtools build and a release build can run at the same time without
      either taking the other's clients. Their pipe names differ by that last
      segment; the database and the recordings folder are still shared.
- [ ] A second `ninja-recorder.exe --daemon` exits **0** immediately and
      silently, leaving the first running. Confirm the exit code and confirm
      the first daemon's log has nothing new in it.
- [ ] Kill the daemon with Task Manager, then start it again. It binds the pipe
      on the first try: a killed daemon must not leave the name unusable.
- [ ] With the daemon running and a game in progress, the recording continues
      with no UI process at all. This is the whole point of the split, and it
      is also §3.2's exit criterion.
- [ ] Stop the daemon while it is recording. The recording is finalized before
      the process exits, and the row is in the library when it comes back.

**Not in the daemon yet**, so do not look for them: the tray icon (3.3), the
updater (3.6) and desktop notifications. The dev portal's `dev_*` commands do
run there since WS3.7 and can be invoked over the pipe, but the portal window
itself still talks to the UI process until WS3.4's proxy lands. Running the UI and the daemon together means two supervisors watching for
the same game, which is expected rather than a defect to report.

**The Run key still points at `--hidden`**, so §5.0.2 is unchanged and a login
start is still the UI. That is deliberate rather than pending: the two
prerequisites are in
[DEVELOPMENT.md §12](../DEVELOPMENT.md#12-process-model-a-recorder-daemon-and-a-ui-that-can-leave).
When it does move, §5.0.2's "sign out and back in" row is the one that changes,
and the row to add beside it is that an entry written by an older build still
says `--hidden` and must keep working.

### 5.0.6 The UI as a client of the daemon

Since WS3.4 the window runs no recorder of its own: every command it issues is
forwarded to the daemon over the pipe, and the daemon pushes a snapshot and a
stream of events back. None of this can be checked off Windows, because it
needs a window.

- [ ] With no daemon running, launch the UI. It starts one (`daemon::spawn`),
      connects, and the library and settings render normally. Task Manager
      shows two `ninja-recorder.exe` processes.
- [ ] `app_data_dir()/logs/` now holds both `ui.log` and `daemon.log`, and
      neither rotates the other.
- [ ] **The exit criterion for 3.4.** Start a game and let recording begin.
      Kill the UI process from Task Manager, then launch it again. Within one
      reconnect it shows the recording still in flight, with the elapsed time
      continuing rather than restarting. The VOD is complete and playable
      afterwards.
- [ ] Quit the daemon while the UI is open. The UI reports a lost connection
      rather than hanging, and reconnects when a daemon is started again.
- [ ] Start a recording, then close the UI window entirely. The recording
      continues and the row appears in the library when the UI is reopened.
- [ ] **The exit criterion for 3.7.** With a devtools build, open the dev
      portal and work through every panel. Each one drives the *daemon's*
      database, supervisor and recorder: Overview's counts, Database's tables,
      Simulate's state injection and Log's files should all describe the daemon
      process, and the Log panel's active file should be `daemon.log`.
- [ ] Version skew: run the UI from one build against a daemon from another
      whose `PROTOCOL` differs. The UI must say a restart is required and must
      **not** ask the daemon to quit, because it might be recording.

**Not verifiable here, and expected to be missing:** desktop notifications for
recording started, finished and failed. They belong to the daemon, which cannot
raise them until WS3.3. Do not file these as bugs against this build.

### 5.1 Capture-backend lifecycle

New with `prepare`/`release`; none of it can be exercised off Windows.

- [ ] `extprocess_recorder.exe` is absent at app start, appears with the League
      client, and disappears when the client closes.
- [ ] The app log's `[recorder] backend:` line reads `libobs (idle)` at startup,
      not `libobs (ready)`.
- [ ] **A game recorded minutes after the client opened still works.** The
      backend is now brought up well before `start`, so this checks it is still
      healthy after sitting warm through champ select.
- [ ] **Several games in one session.** Bring-up/tear-down now repeats across a
      session (client restart, or closing and reopening the client). Watch for
      a leak, a stale GPU device, or a second worker process.
- [ ] Closing the client *mid-recording* does not tear the backend down under a
      live encoder; the recording should finalize normally.
- [ ] A machine where libobs fails to initialize surfaces
      `libobs (unavailable: …)` in the dev portal's health panel rather than
      failing at startup.

### 5.2 Memory, by the v2 method

Added by WS0 task 0.1. Nothing above is renumbered or rewritten; §5's original
table stays as the record of what was measured in v1 and how.

What it does not do is say which of several different numbers "9 MB" was.
[docs/measurement.md](measurement.md) defines the one this project uses from
here: **Private Bytes** as the headline, because it excludes shared pages and
is the honest cost to the machine; **Working Set** recorded alongside it,
because that is the column Task Manager shows a user; both **sampled at 1 Hz
for 60 seconds** and reported as median with the range, because a single
reading catches whatever the allocator was doing at the time.

Fill the rows in with [`scripts/measure.ps1`](../scripts/measure.ps1), which
emits the row itself so the transcription cannot introduce a typo:

```powershell
.\scripts\measure.ps1 -Label 'v1 0.8.0 - window closed' `
    -InstallPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ninja-recorder"
```

**Do not estimate a cell.** An empty row is a true statement about what has
been measured; a plausible number in it is not. WS0.2 fills these three in on
the Windows box.

| State | Process | Private Bytes (median) | Private (min-max) | Working Set (median) | WS (min-max) | Install | Samples |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 0.8.0 - window closed | ninja-recorder | | | | | | |
| v1 0.8.0 - window open | ninja-recorder | | | | | | |
| v1 0.8.0 - League client open | ninja-recorder | | | | | | |

**Window closed is the row the [§1.2](../DEVELOPMENT.md) ceiling is about.** The
other two are recorded so that the cost of the webview and the cost of a warm
capture backend are each visible, rather than folded into one figure that
describes neither.

WS7.1 appends the v2.0.0 rows beneath these, in the four states the process
split creates: daemon only, daemon + UI, daemon + League client, all three.
**Daemon only is the one gated against C3**: it is what runs at login and what
runs for the twenty-three hours a day nobody has the window open. The
two-process total is recorded and not gated.

## 6. Open questions specific to the capture backend

These are the things nobody has been able to answer by reading the code:

- [ ] Does `window_capture` forced to WGC (`method=2`) actually produce frames
      for League's borderless and windowed modes?
- [ ] Does the faststart remux on stop actually run against a real capture?
- [ ] **Does the duration probe work off the bundled `ffmpeg.exe`?** Drop a
      handful of video files the app did not record into the recordings
      folder, press Rescan, and confirm each card shows a real LENGTH rather
      than the empty-value placeholder. This is the only place `ffmpeg -i`
      output is parsed
      ([DEVELOPMENT.md §4.1](../DEVELOPMENT.md)), and the wording it parses
      has only ever been checked against a hand-written sample.
- [ ] **Time a first startup against a large existing folder** (a few hundred
      files, none of them in the DB). The probe spawns one ffmpeg per file on
      the import branch and startup reconcile is inline, so this is the cost
      §4.1 says to watch. A settled folder should spawn nothing on the next
      launch; confirm the second start is fast.
- [ ] Does the bundled resource path (`target/libobs` → next to the installed
      `.exe`) resolve correctly in an installed build, and does dev mode need
      the staging step to also copy into `target/debug/libobs`?
- [ ] Are encoder priority and the window-size retry timing sensible against
      real hardware? They are first-cut defaults, not tuned.

### Multi-track audio ([DEVELOPMENT.md §2.5](../DEVELOPMENT.md#25-multi-track-audio))

Nothing below can be checked off Windows. Use `ffprobe`, because the failure
modes here are silent, and the app's own UI will not show you most of them.

- [ ] **Does `wasapi_process_output_capture` produce non-silent samples for a
      Vanguard-protected `League of Legends.exe`?** This is the big one: every
      preset naming "game audio" depends on it and there is no automatic
      fallback. If it fails, Desktop is the documented workaround.
- [ ] Record with each preset. Confirm the track *count* and order match the
      table in §2.5, and that a Game-only recording contains no microphone
      audio.
- [ ] Confirm track 0 is the combined mix and tracks 1+ are genuinely
      isolated, **not four copies of the same mix**, which is what a missing
      `obs_source_set_audio_mixers` call produces and what the app cannot
      detect on its own.
- [ ] Confirm the faststart remux preserved every track. `-c copy` without
      `-map` silently keeps one audio stream, and the remux renames over the
      original, so this is unrecoverable if it regresses.
- [ ] `ffprobe` shows `DISPOSITION:default=1` on `a:0` and `0` on the rest.
- [ ] Discord audio lands on its own track and is absent from the game stem.
      With Discord *not* running, the track should be silent rather than the
      recording failing.
- [ ] On a non-English client, game audio is still captured. This is what the
      `priority = 2` (match-by-executable) fix in the fork is for.
- [ ] The microphone picker lists real devices, and "Windows default" records
      from the device the user expects. libobs resolves an input `device_id`
      of `"default"` as the default *communications* device, which commonly
      differs from the default device when a headset is plugged in.
- [ ] In the review player: switching stems plays the right audio, stays in
      sync across seeks, speed changes and pauses, and mute/volume behave.
      Confirm the sidecar cache lands in `recordings/audio-tracks/` and that
      deleting the VOD removes it.
- [ ] **The two post-game LCU shapes, which no one here has seen.** Both
      `/lol-end-of-game/v1/eog-stats-block` and
      `/lol-match-history/v1/games/{gameId}` are modelled from the LCU's own
      OpenAPI spec, not from a captured response. Run `dev_lcu_get` on each
      after a real game, commit the trimmed responses under `fixtures/lcu/`,
      and correct the parsers if they differ. Specifically: does the eog block
      carry `teams[].isPlayerTeam`/`isWinningTeam`, and are its scoreboard keys
      really `CHAMPIONS_KILLED`/`NUM_DEATHS`/`ASSISTS`?
- [ ] **The deferred patch end to end.** Play a game, then watch the card fill
      in `role` and a queue label on its own within a minute of the finalize,
      with no manual refresh. `dev_patch_match_summary` drives the same path against
      an existing row without playing another game. Check the log for a
      disagreement warning: the LCU and Live Client Data must never report a
      different winner, and if they do, the wrong game was matched.
- [ ] **Start the app during a game.** It should begin recording rather than
      waiting for the next one; the gameflow watch now reads the current
      phase on connect instead of only reacting to changes (#75). The same
      path is what lets a recording resume after anything interrupts it
      mid-game.
- [ ] **A recording survives a brief Live Client Data outage.** #74 tolerates
      five consecutive transport failures; confirm a momentary blip no longer
      finalizes the VOD, and that a genuinely ended game still finalizes
      within a few seconds.
- [ ] **`logs/libobs.log` exists and has content after a capture.** The
      worker's stderr is redirected into it before the process spawns
      (#69); confirm libobs's own startup lines, the encoder it chose and
      the adapter it picked are all in there, and that the dev portal's Log
      panel can select and read the file.
- [ ] Does gameflow report a distinct phase while spectating? If it reports
      `InProgress`, spectated games are currently recorded, which the design
      says they should not be.
- [ ] Does the app recover state after machine sleep/wake mid-session?
